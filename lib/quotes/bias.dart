    '''Bias (/ˈbaɪəs/; Greek: Βίας ὁ Πριηνεύς; fl. 6th century BC) of Priene was a Greek sage. He is widely accepted as one of the Seven Sages of Greece and was renowned for his probity. Bias was born at Priene and was the son of Teutamus.[1] He is said to have been distinguished for his skill as an advocate, and for his use of it in defence of the right.[2] In reference to which Demodocus of Leros uttered the following saying – "If you are a judge, give a Prienian decision," and Hipponax said, "More powerful in pleading causes than Bias of Priene."[3]

He was always reckoned among the Seven Sages, and was mentioned by Dicaearchus as one of the Four to whom alone that title was universally given — the remaining three being Thales, Pittacus, and Solon.[4] Satyrus placed him at the head of the Seven Sages,[1] and even Heraclitus, who poured scorn on figures such as Hesiod and Pythagoras,[5] referred to Bias as "a man of more consideration than any."[6] One of the examples of his great goodness is the legend that says that Bias paid a ransom for some women who had been taken prisoner. After educating them as his own daughters, he sent them back to Messina, their homeland, and to their fathers.[1]

Bias is said to have died at a very advanced age while pleading a cause for his client. After he had finished speaking, he rested his head on his grandson. When the advocate on the opposite side had spoken, the judges decided in favor of Bias's client, by which time Bias had died.[2] The city gave him a magnificent funeral and inscribed on his tomb:[7]

Here Bias of Priene lies, whose name
Brought to his home and all Ionia fame.''';
