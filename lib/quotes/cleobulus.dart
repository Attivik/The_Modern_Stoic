  '''I am a brazen maiden lying here
Upon the tomb of Midas. And as long
As water flows, as trees are green with leaves,
As the sun shines and eke the silver moon,
As long as rivers flow, and billows roar,
So long will I upon this much wept tomb,
Tell passers by, "Midas lies buried here.''',

    '''Cleobulus (/ˌklioʊˈbjuːləs, kliˈɒbjələs/; Greek: Κλεόβουλος ὁ Λίνδιος, Kleoboulos ho Lindios; fl. 6th century BC[citation needed]) was a Greek poet and a native of Lindos. He is one of the Seven Sages of Greece. Cleobulus was the son of Evagoras and a citizen of Lindus in Rhodes.[1] Clement of Alexandria called Cleobulus king of the Lindians,[2] and Plutarch spoke of him as the tyrant.[3] The letter quoted by Diogenes Laërtius, in which Cleobulus invites Solon to Lindus as a democratic place of refuge from the tyrant Peisistratus in Athens, is undoubtedly a later forgery.[4] Cleobulus is also said to have studied philosophy in Egypt.[5] He had a daughter, Cleobulina, who found fame as a poet, composing riddles in hexameter verse.[5] Cleobulus is said to have lived to the age of seventy,[6] and to have been greatly distinguished, for strength and beauty of person.[5]''';
