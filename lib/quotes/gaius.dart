  "Being good is the same as being a philosopher. If you obey your father, you will follow the will of a man; if you choose the philosopher's life, the will of God. It is plain, therefore, that your duty lies in the pursuit of philosophy.",
  "Choose to die well while you can; wait too long, and it might become impossible to do so.",
  "For mankind, evil is injustice and cruelty and indifference to a neighbor’s trouble, while virtue is brotherly love and goodness and justice and beneficence and concern for the welfare of your neighbor.",
  "For what does the man who accepts insult do that is wrong? It is the doer of wrong who puts themselves to shame-the sensible man wouldn't go to the law, since he wouldn't even consider that he had been insulted!",
  '''  Besides, to be annoyed or angered about such things would be petty-instead easily and silently bear what has happened, since this is appropriate for those whose purpose is to be noble-minded.''',
  "From good people you’ll learn good, but if you mingle with the bad you’ll destroy such soul as you had.",
  "Generally speaking, if you devote yourself to the life of philosophy, whilst tilling the land at the same time, I couldn’t compare it to any other way of life, nor would I prefer any other livelihood.",
  "Humanity must seek what is not simple and obvious using the simple and obvious.",
  "If we were to measure what is good by how much pleasure it brings, nothing would be better than self-control- if we were to measure what is to be avoided by its pain, nothing would be more painful than lack of self-control.",
  "If you accomplish something good with hard work, the labor passes quickly, but the good endures.",
  "If you do something shameful in pursuit of pleasure, the pleasure passes quickly, but the shame endures.",
  "If you choose death because it is the greater evil, what sense is there in that? Or if you choose it as the lesser-evil, remember who gave you the choice. Why not try coming to terms with what you have been given?",
  "In our control is the most beautiful and important thing, the thing because of which even the god himself is happy— namely, the proper use of our impressions. We must concern ourselves absolutely with the things that are under our control and entrust the things not in our control to the universe.",
  "Indeed, how could exile be an obstacle to person’s own cultivation, or to attaining virtue when no one has ever been cut off from learning or practicing what is needed by exile?",
  "It is living more in accord with nature-drawing your sustenance directly from the earth-the nurse and mother of us all-rather than from another source.",
  "It is not possible to live well today unless you treat it as your last day.",
  "It is widely held that we'll be despised by others if we don't try hard to hurt the first enemies we meet – this is the mark of cold-hearted, ignorant individuals.",
  "We say that the detestable person is recognized (among other things) by their inability to harm their enemies – actually, they are much more easily recognized by their inability to help them.",
  "Just as plants receive nourishment for survival, not pleasure – for humans, food is the medicine of life.",
  "Therefore it is appropriate for us to eat for living, not pleasure, especially if we want to follow the wise words of Socrates, who said \"Most men live to eat; I eat to live.\"",
  "Just as there is no use in medical study unless it leads to the health of the human body, so there is no use to a philosophical doctrine unless it leads to the virtue of the human soul.",
  "Most of all, teachers shouldn't only be speakers of helpful words, but their actions should be consistent with them. The pupil's duty is to attend pro-actively to what is said, and to be on guard in case they accept something false without thinking.",
  '''Of the things that exist, God has put some in our control, others not in our control. In our control he has put the noblest and most excellent part by reason of which He is Himself happy, the power of using our impressions. For when this is correctly used, it means serenity, cheerfulness, constancy; it also means justice and law and self-control and virtue as a whole. But all other things He has not put in our control. Therefore we ought to become of like mind with God and, dividing things in like manner, we ought in every way to lay claim to the things that are in our control, but what is not in our control we ought to entrust to the universe and gladly yield to it whether it asks for our children, our country, our body, or anything whatsoever.''',

  "That God who made man provided him food and drink for the sake of preserving his life and not for giving him pleasure, one can see very well from this: when food is performing its real function, it does not produce pleasure for man, that is in the process of digestion and assimilation.",
  '''The best livelihood (particularly for the strong) is earning a living from the soil, whether you own your land or not. Many can support their families by farming land owned by the state or private landowners. Some even get rich through hard work with their own hands.
The earth repays those who cultivate her, both justly and well, multiplying what she received – endowing in abundance all the necessities of life to anyone willing to work-and all this without violating your dignity or self-respect!''',
  "The human being is born with an inclination toward virtue.",
  "To accept injury without a spirit of savage resentment-to show ourselves merciful toward those who wrong us-being a source of good hope to them-is characteristic of a benevolent and civilized way of life.",
  "To many people, even to most, despite living safely in their home city, fear of what seem to them the dire consequences of free speech is present.",

    '''Gaius Musonius Rufus (/ˈruːfəs/, Greek: Μουσώνιος Ῥοῦφος) was a Roman Stoic philosopher of the 1st century AD. He taught philosophy in Rome during the reign of Nero and so was sent into exile in 65 AD, returning to Rome only under Galba. He was allowed to stay in Rome when Vespasian banished all other philosophers from the city in 71 AD although he was eventually banished anyway, returning only after Vespasian's death. A collection of extracts from his lectures still survives. He is also remembered for being the teacher of Epictetus.''';
